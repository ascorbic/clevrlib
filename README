CleVR Actionscript 3 Library

2007-09-26

***Matrix Algebra***
This library provides some classes for linear algebra. It's ported from the NIST's JAMA Java Matrix 
library.

It's not a full port - only the classes that we needed for CleVR have been ported, 
so there are not all the decomposition classes in JAMA. There are also a few methods missing from the
RealMatrix class.

The main class is called RealMatrix, so as to not conflict with the Matrix class in AS3.

***Bitmap interpolation***
InterpolatedBitmapData adds support for bicubic and bilinear interpolation to
the Actionscript BitmapData class.

It adds two public methods - getPixelBilinear and getPixelBicubic. You can call these with 
sub-pixel coordinates and it will interpolate the RGB value for that point.

***Histogram stretching***
This class provides simple methods for generating a histogram from an image, and from that creating ColorTransforms 
and ColorMatrixFilters for doing histogram stretching. 

The comments in class should be self-explanatory.

See http://www.clevr.com/ for any updates. You'll also find CleVR to be the best way to create and share 
panoramic photos. This library was created for the CleVR Stitcher, and Adobe AIR panoramic photo stitcher.
